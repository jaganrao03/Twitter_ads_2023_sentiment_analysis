Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to classify tweets based on the sentiment expressed in them: positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis on Twitter is crucial for various applications, such as businesses gauging public opinion about their products, predicting political elections, and forecasting socioeconomic phenomena like stock market trends.

Introduction

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. We explore various feature extraction methods and compare the performance of different machine learning models to develop an accurate and automatic classifier for real-time sentiment analysis of tweets.
Requirements

    Python 3.7+
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn
    NLTK
    Gensim
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn

Dataset

We use a publicly available dataset containing labeled tweets for sentiment analysis. The dataset consists of tweets with corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).
Preprocessing

    Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words.
    Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.
    Removal of stopwords: Eliminating commonly used words that don't carry significant meaning.
    Removal of special characters and emojis.

Feature Extraction

We explore different feature extraction techniques to represent text data, such as:

    Bag of Words
    TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
    Word2Vec

Model Training

We compare and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms, such as:

    Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    Random Forest
    XGBoost
    Logistic Regression
    Naive Bayes
    Deep Learning (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks)

Model Evaluation

We use standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of the trained models.
Results Visualization

We visualize the results, including the most common words and hashtags associated with each sentiment class, and understand the underlying patterns in the data.
Deployment

We develop a robust and accurate sentiment classifier that can be deployed for real-time sentiment analysis of tweets using an API or as a standalone application.
